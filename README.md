Attempting Triangular Arbitrage

# Where is it at?

well this project did used to work on Kucoin, but since it no longer supports kyc for US customers, i've had to move to Binance.us.
It seems that arbitrages are much less common on Binance, and Binance does not support ktc which made calculating fees much easier. 
I think this project is dead :(
